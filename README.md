# Collision Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is both a university assignment made for testing my understanding of the object oriented paradigm and a personal project focused on simulating collisions among circles in a virtual environment but it was made to be extended to multiple shapes since I will continue to work on it also after the graduation for didactic reasons, so I made an architecture that made it easy to expand. The project is structured into three main packages: `app`, `shapes`, and `physics`. The `physics` package is further divided into three sub-packages: `world`, `math`, and `body`. Each package and sub-package has a specific role in the simulation, enabling modular design and separation of concerns.

### 1. **`app` Package**
   - **Purpose:** This package contains the main application logic that initializes the simulation and manages user interactions.
   - **Functionality:** 
     - Initializes the simulation environment.
     - Loads and configures the main elements of the simulation

### 2. **`shapes` Package**
   - **Purpose:** Contains the geometric shapes used in the collision simulation.
   - **Functionality:** 
     - Provides a set of basic shapes that can be rendered on screen
     - probably this package will be updated in the future for handling also rotated shapes and more general shapes like polygons by using more complex algorithms.
     - possible algorithms: Ray casting algorithm, Graham scan Algorithm 

### 3. **`physics` Package**
   - **Purpose:** Handles all physics-related calculations and simulations, divided into three sub-packages for modularity

   #### a. **`world` Sub-Package**
   - **Functionality:** 
     - Defines the environment and runs the simulation loop.
     - manage the movement of the bodies
     - Handles the main loop of the simulation.

   #### b. **`math` Sub-Package**
   - **Functionality:** 
     - Handles all mathematical computations necessary for the simulation, such as vector arithmetic.
     - Implements the collision detection logic, ensuring that collisions are accurately detected and responded to.

   #### c. **`body` Sub-Package**
   - **Functionality:** 
     - Models physical bodies within the simulation, including their physical properties and interactions.
     - describes all the body properties and encapsulates them.
     - it contains members that are still not implemented because as I said before this project was made to be extended in the future.




## Usage
- Modify the parameters of the shapes that will be generated by using the provided UI elements.
- The results of the simulation, including any collision events, will be displayed on the console or a graphical interface, depending on the implementation.

## Contributing
the project was bases on another project of the Professor of UNIMORE Nicola Bicocchi, indeed the packages contains his name, this is the original [project](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-java-javafx/tree/main/code/desktop-geometry)
